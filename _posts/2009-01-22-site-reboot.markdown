So sometime this summer, I set up WadeTandy.com as an attemp to start writing, sharing, and discussing with the world.  I chose WordPress as my platform, added a flashy theme and some very trendy (and possibly ill-advised) AJAX plugins.  I wrote the first post...and never came back.  I have decided that this is unacceptable, so I have decided to do a total reboot to wadetandy.com.  I have thrown out all previous posts, and the site will now be not just a blog, but my personal website which will feature a blog.  This will be a one stop shop for anything you need to know about me.  If you want to know about me professionally, you can find whatever you need to know.  If you are interested in my musings, there will be some of that here as well.I will also slowly be adding details about personal projects I am working on.  Currently everything is under wraps while they are being developed into a more fully formed ideas.  Hopefully soon I'll have some info up about my first major project though.  I'm very excited about it and I think others will be too.With that said, prepare yourselves for some real content coming in the very near future.
